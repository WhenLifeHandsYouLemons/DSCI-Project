# UBC DSCI 100 Project

At some point in our lives we must decide on how to make a living. People wish to find a path that leads to the most success without using too many resources, and one of the main problems to that is education. The decision to pursue a higher education is both time and money-consuming, which is why our Data Science project question is: "Can we predict the highest level of education someone has received based on their salary, years of experience, and age?"

The dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/salary-prediction-data).
