# UBC DSCI 100 Project

It is generally conceived that the salary amount of a worker depends on job type and experience, but we would like to see if it is possible to reduce this back further to education level. The ability for someone to get a “better” job tends to depend on their education level, which is why our Data Science project question is: "Can we predict the salary of a worker depending on their education level and years of working experience in their job?”

The dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/salary-prediction-data).
