    "At some point in our lives we must decide on how to make a living. People wish to find a path that leads to the most success without using too many resources, and one of the main problems to that is education. The decision to pursue a higher education is both time and money-consuming, which is why our Data Science project question is: \"Can we predict the highest level of education someone has received based on their salary, years of experience, and age?\"\n",

Instead of gender and location, which lack any significant relationship to a person's education, these can be applied to many people. Furthermore, while the job title variable may have some correlations, there is too much variance in the levels of education for each title that it is not suitable. Suppose a high school student looking into jobs at a certain salary range, then this data can provide insight into the average age, experience, and education standard for the desired amount. Additionally, by using graphs to visualize this information, people can make an informed decision and thus plan out their future accordingly."
