    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "People go into the job industry with varying circumstances regarding the way they were raised, taught, and born. At some point in our lives we are made to think about the question, \"What should I do when I grow up?\" Most of the time the answer lands on finding a path to make a living out of. But as young people who have not fully experienced what being a part of society is like yet, we wish to find a path that leads us to the most success without pouring too many resources into achieving the needed qualifications, and the biggest obstacle to that is education. The decision to pursue a higher education is both time and money-consuming, and there is no taking back choice once it has been made. That is why our Data Science project question is: \"Can we predict the highest level of education someone has received based on their salary, years of experience, and age?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using contains 7 columns reading left to right: `Education`, `Experience`, `Location`, `Job_Title`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Salary`, where each row represents an individual worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Education`: four categories, each representing the highest level of education received: High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD\n",
    "- `Experience`: years of total work experience earned in their listed job\n",
    "- `Location`: location of work split into three categories: Urban, Suburban, Rural\n",
    "- `Job_Title`: four general types of job titles: Manager, Director, Analyst, Engineer\n",
    "- `Age`: age of the worker\n",
    "- `Gender`: Female or Male\n",
    "- `Salary`: salary of the worker  "
