    "It is generally conceived that the salary amount of a worker depends on job type and experience, but we would like to see if it is possible to reduce this back further to education level. The ability for someone to get a “better” job tends to depend on their education level, which is why our Data Science project question is: \"Can we predict the salary of a worker depending on their education level and years of working experience in their job?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using contains 7 columns reading left to right: `Education`, `Experience`, `Location`, `Job_Title`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Salary`, where each row represents an individual worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Education`: four categories representing the highest level of education received: High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD\n",
    "- `Experience`: years of professional experience\n",
    "- `Location`: three locations of work: Urban, Suburban, Rural\n",
    "- `Job_Title`: four general job titles: Manager, Director, Analyst, Engineer\n",
    "- `Age`: age\n",
    "- `Gender`: Female or Male\n",
    "- `Salary`: annual salary"

    "The results are about what we expected to find. The higher the education level of an individual, the greater the range of salary they are predicted to have. Salary ranges increase going from high school to Bachelor, to Master, to PhD. The same trend is seen already in employability, where people with higher degrees earned in post-secondary education find it easier to attain a job. Statistics in Canada from 2007 describe a 75.5% employment rate for high school graduates and an 83.2% employment rate for university graduates. Employability is also a factor in job prospects, so seeing it have a positive relationship with higher degrees of education tell us that our salary range predictions make sense."

    "As seen from the results on the graphs, there is a trend where the people with higher academic achievements typically earn a larger salary, increasing more if they also have decades of work experience. With this information, students coming out of high school, unsure whether or not they should go into post-secondary, can reference this report to see if it is worth the investment. This is especially true if their family is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot afford to send their children to college or university. It helps people make more informed decisions on how high they would like to go in their education to reach their desired salary. They could either stay at a lower level and focus on gaining more experience to earn higher pay (Gao, 2024), or increase their potential salary by spending extra effort and time by achieving a master’s or a PhD.
